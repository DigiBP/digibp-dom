In the following ReadMe file the recruitment process is documented with all it`s aspects and included services within 
the process.
The process starts with the request of a department manager for a new employee. The reqeust goes to the department 
head When the Department head rejects the request the process ends, when he/she approves the process proceeds. 

When approved: The department head sends an approval notification to the department manager. When the 
manager gets the approval he/ she than starts preparing the job description for the new position. 
Two possible roots can than be executed: 

- either the open position already refers to an existing job description, 
- or new job description needs to be prepared. 

After finishing up the job description the manager sends the description file to the HR 
Department. In the HR Department an Employee finishes up the description file and posts the description on company 
website. After the posting the waits for two weeks in order to gather applications.After the two weeks, inappropriate 
applications will be sorted out by HR staff and recorded in a list. The list is then forwarded to the manager, who 
again performs a sorting, updates the list and sends it to HR. In the HR, telephone interviews with the selected 
candidates are agreed on the basis of the list in order to check the details of the candidates and to screen out 
unsuitable candidates. 

The telephone interviews are evaluated on the basis of a decision-making table. After the 
interviews, candidates are sorted out again and the list of applicants re-updated. The new list is again sent to the 
manager, who again performs a sorting and sends the new list back to HR. Based on the new list, personal interviews 
with the candidates will now be arranged. Subsequently, the interview panel will be informed about the times to conduct 
the interviews.The evaluation of the personal interviews takes place via the interview panel.
Candidates are also evaluated using a decision table. then a candidate for the open position is decided.
The decision is communicated to the HR, which subsequently informs all candidates accordingly and sends the contract 
to the decided candidate. After the conclusion of the contract, the process is completed.
